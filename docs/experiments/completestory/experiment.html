  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  A small group of individuals are playing a writing game together. The rules of the game are as follows:
<p>
   The first writer (Writer 1) starts a story, which subsequent writers add to. But writers can only build on what previous writers have written - they must stay consistent with the facts of the story. 
<p>
   For example, if Writer 1 writes: <i>Bill is wearing a blue shirt</i>, Writer 2 isn't allowed to write: <i>Bill is wearing a red shirt</i>.
<p>
  Your task is to <b>rate the contribution of the last writer</b>, based on whether or not their contribution follows the rules of the game. For this task, we ask that you just think about whether or not the last writer's contribution is consistent with the previous writers. Thanks for participating!
  <p>
  NOTE: After you submit your response, there is a short comprehension question to ensure that you actually read the story. So please read carefully! Failure to answer the comprehension question correctly can adverseley affect your compensation.
